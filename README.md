<a name="Introduction"/>
<h1> Introduction </h1>
This Autodraw Software is designed to automatically draw images. 

Version 2 is a complete rewrite of the original Autodraw program. It is rewritten in C++, and is expected to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Version 2 is currently not avaliable yet. Version 2 will have a C++ application, and a Lua script. The C++ application will run like a normal autodrawer, and the Lua script will be designed specifically for Roblox games, and will have colour support.

Version 1 and Version 0 are both forks of [rainzhao2000](https://github.com/rainzhao2000/autodrawer)'s software, and has been modified to support automatically drawing in Roblox games. Version 0 and 1 are both coded in C#, but Version 0 uses Winforms, while Version 1 uses WPF.

<h2> Windows </h2>

This software officially supports Windows 10 and above. Any versions below may not work properly, but Windows 7 - 8(.1) *can* work.

</a>
<a name="Mac"/>
<h2> Mac </h2>

Mac is not supported, as WPF is Windows-Only. (Version 2 may have Mac support)

Mac users may use [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/au/products/desktop/)

<a name="Linux"/>
<h2> Linux </h2>

Linux is not supported. Under WINE, it should somewhat work but drawing is not functional. (Version 2 may have Linux support)
