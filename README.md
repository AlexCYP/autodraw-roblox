This Autodraw Software is designed to automatically draw images. 

Version 2 is a complete rewrite of the original Autodraw program. It is rewritten in C++, and is expected to run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Version 2 is currently not avaliable yet. Version 2 will have a C++ application, and a Lua script. The C++ application will run like a normal autodrawer, and the Lua script will be designed specifically for Roblox games, and will have colour support.

Version 1 and Version 0 are both forks of [rainzhao2000](https://github.com/rainzhao2000/autodrawer)'s software, and has been modified to support automatically drawing in Roblox games. Version 0 and 1 are both coded in C#, but Version 0 uses Winforms, while Version 1 uses WPF.
